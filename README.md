# General-info 
The idea was to set a simple website with Bootstrap only. I wanted to use as much componens as possible; play a bit with displaying, layouts and different content positioning. The goal was to avoid using CSS which I achieved.

# Technology
Website built with Bootstrap v5.3. No styling, no JS.

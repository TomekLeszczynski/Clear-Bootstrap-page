#general-info 
The idea was to set a simple website with Bootstrap only. Use as much componens as possible, play a bit with display, 


No styling with CSS. No JS 

The idea was to use as much components as possible and optimise display for all devices.

General idea + some of the images are from https://themes.getbootstrap.com/preview/?theme_id=50603
